# To Build
* Cairo (library and header files)
* atk (library and header files)
* pango (library and header files)
* gdk-pixbuf
* gtk (library and header files)
  + This also satifies the dependencies for gdk

On most distributions (eg Fedora, Ubuntu/Debian, etc) the header files are located in a `\*-devel` package. E.g: `cairo-devel`.
